# Data_Structures_City_Planner
The City Planner project is a C++ program designed to help plan routes and travel times between cities. It utilizes graph theory concepts such as breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path between two cities, considering both road and aerial routes.

# Title: City Planner

# Description:
The City Planner project is a C++ program designed to help plan routes and travel times between cities. It utilizes graph theory concepts such as breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path between two cities, considering both road and aerial routes.

# Features:
1. Graph Representation: The program represents cities and their connections using an adjacency matrix for both road and aerial routes.
2. Dynamic Graph Creation: Users can create multiple graphs, each representing a different scenario with varying numbers of cities and aerial routes.
3. BFS Algorithm: The program employs the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path between two cities, taking into account both road and aerial connections.
4. User Interaction: The program provides a user-friendly interface, allowing users to input the number of cities, the number of aerial routes, and the connections between cities.
5. Error Handling: The program includes error handling mechanisms to validate user inputs and ensure the correct execution of algorithms.

# Usage:
1. Start: Users can choose to start the City Planner program.
2. Create Another Graph: Users can create additional graphs to explore different scenarios.
3. Exit: Users can exit the program when finished planning routes.

# Instructions:
1. Enter the number of test cases to create multiple graphs.
2. For each test case, enter the number of cities and the number of aerial routes.
3. Input the connections between cities for aerial routes.
4. The program will display the graph representation and the day number required to reach the destination using the shortest path.

This City Planner project facilitates efficient route planning and optimization, making it useful for city planners, travelers, and logistics professionals.
